# Timer (v.0.1)

Rubik's cube timer app, deployed at [https://jpeer.github.io/timer](https://jpeer.github.io/timer)

=> Hit Space bar to Start/Stop the timer.

## Current Features:

* Offline friendly: 
  * No server side neccessary
  * stores cubing history & user settings using html5 localstorage API
* Visualizes scramble

## TODO:


* Allow clear / truncate / condense cubing times history

* Round off various rough edges in code and CSS layout
